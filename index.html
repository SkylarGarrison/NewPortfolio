      <p>My name is Skylar Garrison and I am a budding software developer from the birthplace of Rock and Roll - Cleveland, Ohio.</p>
      <p> Growing up, I wanted to be many things, but my top two choices were to be a teacher or an engineer. What type of teacher or engineer I wanted to be changed with my experiences, but I had three core wants for my career.</p> 
      <!-- ordered list, will be numbered automatically; from least to most important career needs to me -->
      <ol>
      <li>The ability to learn and face new challenges every day</li>
      <li>To be able to work and interact with others</li>
      <li>To make people happy!</li>
      </ol>

      <!-- the following is a section about my interests as well as why I am excited to learn web development -->
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I started my coding adventure in highschool, with a web design and game development class. Though I've explored other interests, software development has always felt like home to me. No matter what, coding is always where I feel my happiness, and I'm excited to fully explore a career in this field.</p>

      <p> One of my favorite things about software development is that it usually requires a team effort, rather than being a solo career. I'm at my best when I'm working with other people and exhanging thoughts and ideas for the best outcome possible. </p>

      <p> When I'm not coding or working on projects, I enjoy spending time outdoors or relaxing at home. I love walks and bike rides, as well as reading, listening to music, and cooking for my family.</p>
